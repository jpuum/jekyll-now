Recently I came across the edge detection algorithm [1] by Chaudhuri and Dutta, as I wanted to develop a deeper understading how edge detection works in theory and practice, especially in RGB color space. Their proposed algorithm uses some techniques which are also in use in today's state-of-the-art methods. I will provide a brief review of the paper in this post and compare it to the state-of-the-art methods of today. My very unoptimized Python version of this algorithm is available in [GitHub].

## Overview

## Adaptive median filter

## Directional masks

## Thresholding

## Thinning

## Comparison and conclusion
